# SineVita-Public
  SineVita, or “Lifeless”, is a world building game-development project based around a music-harmony driven magic system, with an addition of a self-emergent ecosystem for both faun and fauna. 

  The game exists in a 2.5D environment, where each faun and fauna could be developed and designed artificially, but are meant to play out and evolve without supervision. Inspired by DwarfFortress and RainWorld, the aim of this project is to truly create independent and unique artificial lives with rich, meaningful and impactful interactions between fauns, fauna and the world. Incorporating world building and resonance / harmony based magic systems, emergent music will be a natural consequence of this framework, which we hope to perfect.

  This is a public view-only access to the SineVita project. This would include prototypes, promotional material and class references. Project SineVita is still in its early stage, with only a few months in development. Any attention is considered great support! Thanks for visiting!
